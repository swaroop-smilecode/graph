### Programmatic representation of directed graph
Programatically, directed graph is represented by dictionary. In graph terms, this dictionary is called as `Adjacency list`.</br>
`nodes` are `keys` & `neighbors` are corresponding `values`.</br>

```python
graph = {
    'f': ['g', 'i'],
    'g': ['h'],
    'h': [],
    'i': ['g', 'k'],
    'j': ['i'],
    'k': []
}
```
### How to traverse the directed graph?
There are 2 algorithms to traverse directed graph. They are:</br>
#### DFS - Depth First Search
- Let's assume you started from node `a` to explore the graph.
- Pick any one of the neighbor & explore the path connected to that neighor fully before coming to next neighbor.</br>

#### BFS - Breadth First Search
- Let's assume you started from node `a` to explore the graph.
- Explore all the neighbors of `a` one after the other.

### Why DFS & BFS are exploring the graph in different ways?

#### Note:
Node `a` has 2 neighbors named `b` & `c`.</br>
- While exploring with DFS, if you want to explore the path of node `b` first, then push `b` into the stack at last(after pushing all other neighours).</br>
- Where as while exploring with BFS, if you want to explore the path of node `b` first, then push `b` into the queue at first(before pushing all other neighours).
