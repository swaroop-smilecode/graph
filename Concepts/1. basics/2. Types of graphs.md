### Types of Graphs
There are 2 types of graphs.</br>
1. <ins>Directed graph</ins></br>
   Look at the below picture. You can travel from `c` to `e`, but can not travel from `c` to `a`.</br>
   So, `c` neighbor's is only `e`
2. <ins>Undirected graph</ins></br>
   Look at the below picture. You can travel from `c` to either `e` or `a`.</br>
   So, `c` neighbor's are `e` & `a`

#### Programmatic representation of directed graph
Programatically, directed graph is represented by dictionary. In graph terms, this dictionary is called as `Adjacency list`.</br>
`nodes` are `keys` & `neighbors` are corresponding `values`.</br>

```python
graph = {
    'f': ['g', 'i'],
    'g': ['h'],
    'h': [],
    'i': ['g', 'k'],
    'j': ['i'],
    'k': []
}
```
