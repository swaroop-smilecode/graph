### Types of Graphs
There are 2 types of graphs.</br>
1. <ins>Directed graph</ins></br>
   Look at the below picture. You can travel from `c` to `e`, but can not travel from `c` to `a`.</br>
   So, `c` neighbor's is only `e`
2. <ins>Undirected graph</ins></br>
   Look at the below picture. You can travel from `c` to either `e` or `a`.</br>
   So, `c` neighbor's are `e` & `a`
